## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

<h3>HTML</h3>
Now I see that I don't need to add every element into a separate <div> container. This way, I can create HTML code faster and more easily.

<h3>CSS</h3>
I also understand how helpful it is to use CSS Resets when working with styles. 
It creates the same spacing for all elements that have a subsequent element.

```
```I really like this part of CSS styles:
.card > * + * {
  margin-top: 1rem;
}
```

Additionally, I used only % and rem units, so I hope that will help make the design more responsive.


### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue improving my skills with CSS Grid and Flexbox to create more complex and responsive layouts. Additionally, I plan to learn more about JavaScript to add interactive elements to my web pages. I also want to refine my use of CSS animations to make user interfaces more engaging.

Also, I want to focus on optimizing my projects for mobile devices. Currently, I believe this is one of the most important components of modern web development. My goal is to ensure that my websites are fully responsive and provide a seamless user experience across all screen sizes.
